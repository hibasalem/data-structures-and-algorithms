Implementation of stacks and queues using linked lists

## Challenge

creating classes for each of the LinkedList and the node including methods for searching, inserting and turning it to string on the list then perform unit tests on each class

## Approach & Efficiency


- code chalange 12

  - stack-queue-animal-shelter

    `enqueue(value)` time : o(n) , space O(n)  
    `dequeue()` time : o(1) , space O(1)
